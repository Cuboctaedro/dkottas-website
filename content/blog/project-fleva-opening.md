The opening of the exhibition "Prject Fleva" was yesterday evening. The exhibition presents the photographs of the [book](/work/project-fleva).

It was a great night with many friends coming over and, of course, most of the actors from the film.

For me it was also the first time that I saw the printed book and I was very happy to find out that it came out as we expected.
