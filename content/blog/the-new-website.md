This is my brand-new website. It looks almost identical to the old one. However, it is new. It has been rebuild with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) instead of the [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/).

Not that i had a problem with Kirby, it is a very good solution for a PHP CMS. It is far more powerful than one would expect from a flat-file CMS. But it had been quite some time since I last used it so it was easier for me to work with Next. Also it makes deployment and hosting much easier and cheaper.

It probably is an overkill to use Next.JS for such a simple site. The content is all in markdown files and there is hardly any interactivity. The correct solution would be a proper Static Site Generator like [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). I will probably change to Eleventy soon but now i was anxious to update the website because I have some [great new projects](/work) that I want to share.
