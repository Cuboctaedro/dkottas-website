Vipera is the e-shop of artist Klaus Raszynski where he sells handmade sunglasses, jewelry and accessories all made of recycled skateboard decks.
Each object is unique, made only once and never remade when sold. They are all 100% handmade.

I have worked together with Klaus in establishing a concept for naming the website and objects and creating the logo and identity. Based on these i have designed and developed the website. The website is made using the Kirby CMS.
