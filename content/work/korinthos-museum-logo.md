As part of its rebranding to "Korinthos Folklore and History Museum" the old Folklore Museum of Korinthos needed a new logo. In discussions with the people of the museum it was clear that there was a need for a logo that could function in digital media as well as in print and in the building signage. There was a need to incoroporate the new historical element but also keep the folklore side which has been the museum's main theme until now.

The museum suggested a collection of images of objects and fabrics that could be used a starting point of the design. Although there were many intriguing objects among the images, what struck me as the best starting point were the patterns of the fabrics. After some initial attempts at creating a geometric logo from these patterns I focused on the rhombus shape that appeared in most of the patterns.

The need to marry foklore and history lead to a more "typographic" solution. Didone typefaces are very characteristic of the early Greek state of the 19th century, a period very important for the museum and the city. The final shape came from combining the initials of the museum's name ΙΛΜΚ to create the rhombus shape.
