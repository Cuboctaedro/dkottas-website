The Palace of Mystras is one of the most important Byzantine monuments in Greece. It has been under restore for many years. Lately parts of the palace have been opned for the public.

Since 2019 I have been collaborating with the archeologists, exhibition designers and curators who work on Mystras. I have created various graphics for the permanent exhibition, for temporary exhibitions, signage, booklets and flyers.

Here is a small selection of a still ongoing project.
