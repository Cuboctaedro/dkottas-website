This is a website for an art gallery in Athens. The gallery was founded in 1989 so the website has a big archive of exhibition documentation and many artist portfolios and CV's.

I have started working with the gallery in 2014. This is the second version of the website that we have done together. During this time we have been improving both the front-end and the CMS. With four or five exhibitions per year during 35 years and almsot 50 artists there is a large amount of data to manage and present.
