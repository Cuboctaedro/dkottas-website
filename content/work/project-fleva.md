This is a book of portrait photographs by Anna Maria Hadjistephanou of the actors of the film "Broken Vein" by director Yannis Economides. Hadjistephanou took photographs of the actors before, during and after the shooting. Before the shooting the actors are posing in front of a mirror, during the shooting they are shot when they prepare to go on the set and the photo after is taken with the actors posing in their homes.

The book presents all the photos and contains nine short texts by critics, photographers and some of the actors. An exhibition of the photographs will be held a week before the film premiers on cinemas.

This is my first collaboration with Mperlin Books, a new publishing house that started with this book.
